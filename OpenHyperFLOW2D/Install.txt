Minimum System Requirements
===========================

* CPU:           x86_64 compatible;
* OS:            Linux x86_64 (tested on OpenSUSE 10+, SLES 10+, CentOS 6+, Scientific Linux 5+);
* C++ compiler:  GNU C++ 4.1+ or Intel C++ 10+;

Recommended System Requirements
===============================

The main (and most effective) version of OpenHyperFLOW2D is parallel MPI version.

Recommended requirements for this version:

* CPU: Multicore (4+) CPU with SIMD (SSE2+) instruction support (Intel Xeon or AMD Opteron);
* Linux Cluster 10+ nodes;
* Infiniband interconnect (SDR/DDR/FDR)
* MPI2 library with Infiniband support (Intel MPI v3+, MVAPICH2 v1+, HP MPI).
   OpenMPI also support but have some problem with non-bocking data exchange.
* Latest Intel C++ compiler with support new SIMD features.
* Multicore/multiprocessor workstations are also recommended to use parallel MPI version of
  OpenHyperFLOW2D (OpenMP version is also available, but it has performance problems)


Installation
============

1. Configure C++ compiler

Edit '.compiler' file:

If you are using GNU C++ compiler, select 'COMPILER=GNU', if you are using Intel C++ compiler,
select 'COMPILER=Intel'. Should also specify a used set of SIMD instructions 'SIMD=...' (e.g. 'SIMD=AVX').
For determining the top-end set of SIMD instructions for the current CPU use script get_SIMD.sh

2. Configure parallel features

Edit '.parallel' file:

If you plan to use only the serial version OpenHyperFLOW2D specify an empty parameter 'PARALLEL='.
If you want to use OpenMP version specify 'PARALLEL=OPEN_MP'. It should be noted that the current
version OpenHyperFLOW2D has performance problems. If you are using a multicore/multiprocessor
workstation or HPC cluster, is recommended to use a parallel MPI version OpenHyperFLOW2D,
in this case, specify 'PARALLEL=MPI'. If you chose the MPI version, you must also specify the
vendor of MPI library 'MPIVEND = ...' (e.g. 'MPIVEND=INTEL' or 'MPIVEND=MVAPICH'). Additionally,
you must specify the path to the MPI library in the section corresponding to the selected vendor
(e.g. 'MPI2DIR=/opt/intel/impi/4.1.0')

3. Build

Run command 'make build' of 'make rebuild' for build OpenHyperFLOW2D

4. Run Test Cases

Run command 'make test' for run all test cases or run

  'make ObliqueShock' for Oblique Shock test case

  'make Wedge' for Wedge test case

  'make Step' for Step test case

By default MPI parallel version of OpenHyperFLOW2D use only local machine.
If you are using HPC cluster with several nodes you cat increase number of using nodes.
Just change 'NUM_NODES' parameter in '.parallel' file
